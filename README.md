# Old-Operating-System-Code
Old OS projects I made.

Started when I was in the tenth grade, and continued for about a year until I moved on to other sorts of things.
I offer absolutely no warranty if you want to try and run this on your computer. 
Chances are it won't run unless your computer is extremely ancient (10 yrs).
This code was tested either on a Dell 1560 Inspiron or QEMU, depending on the particular version you pick.

If you want to run it on a live system, the process I used was to image it to a USB using an imaging utility, like 
Rufus for windows or DD for linux. then, just boot from the USB in bios.
